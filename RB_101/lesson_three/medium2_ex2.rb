# RB101-RB109 Lesson 3
# Practice Problems - Medium 2: Question 2

# PROBLEM STATEMENT
=begin
Let's look at object id's again from the perspective of a method call instead of a block.

Here we haven't changed ANY of the code outside or inside of the block/method. We simply took the contents of the block from the previous practice problem and moved it to a method, to which we are passing all of our outer variables.

Predict how the values and object ids will change throughout the flow of the code below:
=end

def fun_with_ids
  a_outer = 42
  b_outer = "forty two"
  c_outer = [42]
  d_outer = c_outer[0]

  a_outer_id = a_outer.object_id
  b_outer_id = b_outer.object_id
  c_outer_id = c_outer.object_id
  d_outer_id = d_outer.object_id

  # This remains the same as in Question 1 (i.e., "Notice that Ruby re-used the "42 object with id 85 when the value was the same.")
  puts "a_outer is #{a_outer} with an id of: #{a_outer_id} before the block."
  puts "b_outer is #{b_outer} with an id of: #{b_outer_id} before the block."
  puts "c_outer is #{c_outer} with an id of: #{c_outer_id} before the block."
  puts "d_outer is #{d_outer} with an id of: #{d_outer_id} before the block."
  puts

  an_illustrative_method(a_outer, b_outer, c_outer, d_outer, a_outer_id, b_outer_id, c_outer_id, d_outer_id) # method will return nil

  # Outer ids will be the same before and after the method call. Reassignment within the method does NOT change the object outside of the method.
  puts "a_outer is #{a_outer} with an id of: #{a_outer_id} BEFORE and: #{a_outer.object_id} AFTER the method call."
  puts "b_outer is #{b_outer} with an id of: #{b_outer_id} BEFORE and: #{b_outer.object_id} AFTER the method call."
  puts "c_outer is #{c_outer} with an id of: #{c_outer_id} BEFORE and: #{c_outer.object_id} AFTER the method call."
  puts "d_outer is #{d_outer} with an id of: #{d_outer_id} BEFORE and: #{d_outer.object_id} AFTER the method call."
  puts

  # The inner variables and ids which were never defined within the fun_with_ids method, so they are not available to the method
  # and will be rescued by "ugh ohhhhh".
  puts "a_inner is #{a_inner} with an id of: #{a_inner_id} INSIDE and: #{a_inner.object_id} AFTER the method." rescue puts "ugh ohhhhh"
  puts "b_inner is #{b_inner} with an id of: #{b_inner_id} INSIDE and: #{b_inner.object_id} AFTER the method." rescue puts "ugh ohhhhh"
