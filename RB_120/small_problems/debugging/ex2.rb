# PROBLEM STATEMENT
=begin
The code below raises an exception. Examine the error message and alter the
code so that it runs without error.

class Animal
  def initialize(diet, superpower)
    @diet = diet
    @superpower = superpower
  end

  def move
    puts "I'm moving!"
  end

  def superpower
    puts "I can #{@superpower}!"
  end
end

class Fish < Animal
  def move
    puts "I'm swimming!"
  end
end

class Bird < Animal
end

class FlightlessBird < Bird
  def initialize(diet, superpower)
    super
  end

  def move
    puts "I'm running!"
  end
end

class SongBird < Bird
  def initialize(diet, superpower, song)
    super
    @song = song
  end

  def move
    puts "I'm flying!"
  end
end

# Examples

unicornfish = Fish.new(:herbivore, 'breathe underwater')
penguin = FlightlessBird.new(:carnivore, 'drink sea water')
robin = SongBird.new(:omnivore, 'sing', 'chirp chirrr chirp chirp chirrrr')

Further Exploration
Is the FlightlessBird#initialize method necessary? Why or why not?

class SongBird < Bird
  def initialize(diet, superpower, song)
    super(diet, superpower)
    @song = song
  end

  def move
    puts "I'm flying!"
  end
end

# Examples

unicornfish = Fish.new(:herbivore, 'breathe underwater')
penguin = FlightlessBird.new(:carnivore, 'drink sea water')
robin = SongBird.new(:omnivore, 'sing', 'chirp chirrr chirp chirp chirrrr')

# Further Exploration
=begin
The FlightlessBird#initialize method isn't really necessary given how the code
is currently structured, because FlightlessBird inherits from Bird which
inherits from Animal, which has the desired initialize method for the
Flightless Bird class.
